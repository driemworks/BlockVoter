# BlockVoter

## About
A web interface which allows a user to create a poll by deploying a contract to the Ethereum blockchain, and also to participate in a poll created by another user. 

## Pre-requisites
To run, you must be connected to an Ethereum blockchain. I reccomend using:
- Metamask if you want to run against the public Ethereum blockchain (or other test nets available)
- Ganache if you want to run the blockchain locally (you should use your browser in incognito mode if you are logged into Metamask as well)
- install the angular-cli

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
